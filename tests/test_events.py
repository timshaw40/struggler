"""Card events fire.

Unit tests pin each implemented event's effect; the property test proves a
full game with events enabled still terminates and keeps every mandated
invariant; the golden replay is the diffable regression that events resolve
deterministically through the seeded dice-as-CHANCE decisions.

Events are unit-tested by driving the public decision loop where practical and,
for a fixed board setup, by calling ``engine._fire_event`` on a bare engine —
the same entry point the engine uses internally — so the assertion is about the
effect, not the plumbing that routes to it.
