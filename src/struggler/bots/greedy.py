"""GreedyPlayer: a hand-crafted heuristic bot with no lookahead or search.

Per docs/BOTS.md: observe the current state, score every legal action of
the current decision, take the top-scoring one. Nothing more -- no
simulating future turns, no search tree, no opponent modeling.

Deliberately built as *weighted features* rather than an if/elif priority
cascade: almost every heuristic funnels through `board_value()`, a single
scalar "how good is this board for `side`" evaluation, and per-action scores
are (mostly) the marginal change to that value from taking the action, or
its dice-free expectation for chance-driven actions (coups, realignment).
This is the intended bridge to a future RL agent (see docs/BOTS.md's
roadmap): a linear model over the same features, with learned instead of
hand-set weights, is a drop-in replacement for `GreedyWeights`.

Coverage: full heuristics for every core board decision kind -- where to
place Influence, which country to Coup or Realign against, which Ops type
to spend on, which card to headline or play, and Ops vs Event vs Space Race
mode. The event-specific decision kinds (WAR_TARGET, EVENT_CHOICE,
EVENT_INFLUENCE, EVENT_OPS_ORDER, QUAGMIRE_DISCARD, HELD_CARD_DISCARD,
EVENT_RESUME, RANDOM_DISCARD's non-CHANCE siblings, ...) fall back to the
first legal option. This is a documented gap, not a bug -- the same
card-by-card growth pattern the event layer itself used; extend
`_SCORERS` as each one gets a heuristic worth writing. `EVENT_CHOICE`
itself now has one card-specific heuristic (Aldrich Ames Remix: discard
the opponent's highest-Ops card) inside `_score_event_choice`, dispatched
by `decision.context["event"]`; every other EVENT_CHOICE-driven card still
falls back to the first option via that same function's default 0.0.

Priority ordering falls directly out of the weight magnitudes, not out of
branch order:
  1. Never choose a Coup (or an Ops type / Coup target that could become
     one) that would drop DEFCON to 1 -- an instant loss for the acting
     side (`defcon_self_kill_penalty`, orders of magnitude above every
     other weight).
  2. A safe Coup with a good expected margin outscores placing Influence
     (`coup_base` plus the expected board-value swing).
    3. Among Influence targets, Battlegrounds and progress toward control
       dominate (`battleground_control` in `board_value`, including partial
       stacks — 1/3 in Poland beats 1/4 in Austria).
  4. A card not worth spending on Ops gets sent to the Space Race instead
     (low `ops_mode_per_point` score vs `space_race_base`).
