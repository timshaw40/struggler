"""The LLM reasoning-layer bot (roadmap tier 3): a `Player` backed by an
injected `LLMClient`.

Design:

- A `pending_decision` with exactly one legal option is returned directly,
  with no LLM call at all.
- Otherwise the bot asks the LLM to predict a short *batch* of its own
  upcoming decisions in one call (mandate #2's atomic action space keeps
  each individual decision small, and CHANCE decisions never reach a
  Player at all -- runner.py resolves them directly -- so "the next
  several decisions with no intervening uncertainty" is a real, useful
  unit to plan in one shot). Each predicted step is validated against the
  *live* `Decision.options` only when actually reached; a mismatch
  discards the rest of the stale plan and triggers a fresh call.
- At the first real decision of each game turn, one extra call produces a
  *turn plan* instead of an action (`schema.TURN_PLAN_SCHEMA`): what each
  card in hand is for, when a Scoring card gets played and what must change
  in its region first, how the Military Operations requirement gets met,
  which Battlegrounds to hold or retake, and contingencies. It is then
  re-injected into every user turn for the rest of that turn, so each
  individual decision is made against a standing intent rather than from
  scratch -- `justification` is explainability, deliberately not memory.
  Planning failure never blocks the game (the turn just plays without a
  plan), and `plan_turns=False` skips the call entirely. That one call can
  be sent to a different `LLMClient` than every other call (`plan_client`):
  a stronger/pricier model for the once-per-turn strategic call, a cheaper
  one for the many per-decision calls. Defaults to `client` (one model for
  everything) when not given. Both clients see the same growing
  conversation -- only which model answers a given call differs.
- Memory is a single, ever-growing conversation (`self._messages`) per
  `LLMPlayer` instance, resent in full on every call. What gets persisted
  per turn is deliberately thinner than what the live call was sent with,
  though: `prompt.build_history_entry` keeps only the event delta ("since
  your last request, X happened"), never the board report/hand dossier/
  cards-in-play a call was actually answered against -- those are a
  snapshot of one instant, true only for the live call that carried them,
  so resending them on every later call would just be paying tokens for a
  stale copy of state the next live call recomputes fresh anyway. The live
  call itself (`_attempt_with_retry`) still gets the full picture; only what
  gets remembered afterward is trimmed. This still relies on the provider's
  prompt caching for cost on the parts that do persist (event history,
  the model's own past reasoning), not on client-side summarization of
  those -- no compaction/safety-valve for them in v1 (see "Known
  limitations" below).
- Every real LLM-consulting call -- a decision or a turn plan -- commits
  exactly one "user" turn and one "assistant" turn to `self._messages`,
  even when an internal retry happened first -- retry noise is resolved locally before
  anything is committed, so the persisted conversation always alternates
  cleanly (a strict requirement of the Messages/Chat Completions APIs) and
  never carries transient error chatter forward into the game's memory.
- Reasoning/justification is recorded in `self.journal`, entirely outside
  the `Engine` and the replay-log format; `JournalEntry.kind` separates a
  turn plan's entry from a decision's -- a `Player`'s own bookkeeping,
  never engine state.
- If `log_path` is given, every real LLM-consulting call also persists a
  full JSON snapshot (conversation, pending plan, journal, cumulative
  token usage) via `conversation_log.py`. This never loads anything by
  itself: a fresh `LLMPlayer` always starts with empty memory, even if a
  snapshot already exists at `log_path` (a stale file from an earlier,
  unrelated game must never be picked up silently -- the engine itself
  always starts a new game unless the caller explicitly reconstructs one --
  see mandate #5 in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md -- and this bot's memory follows
  the same rule).
  Pass `resume=True` to load the existing snapshot at construction time
  instead -- see `conversation_log.py`'s module docstring for the exact
  resumption contract (this only covers the bot's own state; the caller is
  responsible for the `Engine` and `history` halves of resuming a game).

Known limitations are listed in docs/LIMITATIONS.md ("Bots"), not repeated
here -- notably the unbounded conversation growth, the plan-queue matcher's
legality-only check, and `_rng`'s position not surviving a resume. The one
worth knowing while reading this file: `event_summary` in `cards.json` is
the model's only source of card mechanics, and nothing checks it against
`events.py`.
