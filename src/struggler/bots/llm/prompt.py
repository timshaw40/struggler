    "section is the live version of this -- read it every decision):",
    "  - VP comes from Battlegrounds. Presence/Domination/Control all hinge on "
    "who Controls more of them, and each one Controlled is +1 VP on top of the "
    "tier, +1 more if it is adjacent to the enemy superpower.",
    "  - Never leave a Battleground you have Influence in uncontrolled. A "
    "half-built Battleground scores nothing, is the target Truman Doctrine and "
    "Independent Reds are looking for, and is cheap for the opponent to finish.",
    "  - If the opponent breaks your Control of a Battleground, RETAKE IT on "
    "your next action round. A broken Battleground is a swing of at least 2 VP "
    "in every scoring of that region, and it only gets more expensive once they "
    "Control it (placement cost doubles).",
    "  - Finishing a contested Battleground beats opening a new "
    "non-Battleground, every time. Romania, Hungary and Greece do not win games; "
    "Poland, East Germany, Iran and Egypt do.",
    "  - Before spending Ops anywhere, check the RETAKE and AT RISK lists in the "
    "board report. Only spend outside them when nothing there is affordable.",
    "  - Influence that crosses no threshold buys nothing. 'you need +N' in the "
    "board report is the only number that matters: spend N, or spend elsewhere.",
    "  - A live Coup against a Battleground is time-sensitive: the opponent gets "
    "action rounds between yours and can add Influence there before you act, "
    "weakening or spoiling it. Play it as early in the turn as DEFCON and your "
    "hand allow -- do not queue non-urgent Influence placement ahead of it. "
    "Locking in a region for a Scoring card already in your hand is NOT equally "
    "urgent: nothing can take that card from you, so its Ops can wait for a "
    "later action round as long as the region is ready before you play it.",
    "  - Meeting the Military Operations requirement with the cheapest possible "
    "filler Coup (a 1-Op non-Battleground jab) is the floor, not the ceiling. "
    "Before defaulting to that filler, check whether you hold a card that could "
    "instead pay for a second REAL Coup against a live Battleground target -- at "
    "high DEFCON, with cards to spare, a second Battleground Coup is often worth "
    "more than an extra action round of Scoring-region consolidation, especially "
    "before the action round you actually need to play the Scoring card in.",
]

_COMMON_GUIDANCE = [
    "STRATEGIC GUIDANCE (heuristics, not rules):",
    "  - Use events to open regions or make drastic changes, if not, usually Ops are a better use of cards.",
    "  - At DEFCON 3 or higher, a legal Battleground coup is your default best play.",
    "  - Reserve non-Battleground coups for when DEFCON is already at 2"
    "  - 1 or 2 Stability battlegrounds are especially cheap to coup, don't coup countries with more stability.",
    "  - Never trigger a DEFCON-degrading Event on your own AR at DEFCON 2. Same for opponent Events that hand them Ops.",
    "  - Plan every turn to space one card: one with a nasty rival event but without high ops that makes it not worth it using as Ops.",
    "  - Deck reshuffles on turns 3 and 7. From turn 7 on, discarding is removal.",
    "  - Resolve the opponent Event first, then spend the Ops to repair it.",
    "  - Military Ops requirement = DEFCON number; 1 VP to the opponent per point short. Coups and war Events count, Realignments don't.",
    "  - `vp` negative = USSR lead (auto-win at -20); positive = US lead (+20).",
    "  - Presence/Domination/Control are step functions. One Influence that crosses a threshold beats three that don't.",
    "  - Breaking control without taking it wastes the round.",
    "  - Don't overstack a country you control past one coup's worth of margin.",
    "  - Scan 0-0 countries for reachable empty Battlegrounds. Cheapest VP on the board.",
    "  - Controlling all of Europe wins outright when Europe Scoring is played.",
    "  - Turns 1-3 only Asia, Europe and Middle East Scoring exist. Mid War regions arrive on turn 4.",
    "  - A Scoring card in your hand (or one you know is still coming, e.g. the mandatory "
    "Asia/Europe/Middle East cards on turns 1-3) tells you exactly where to spend the turn's Ops: "
    "that region is this turn's priority over opening new fronts elsewhere. It must be played the "
    "turn it's drawn, and your opponent can never play it out of your hand, so there's no race to "
    "beat them to it -- but there's also no reason to sit on it once you're not gaining more by "
    "waiting. Improve the region first if there's still cheap ground to gain, then play the card as "
    "soon as your position there is locked in. That's often your last action round, but don't treat "
    "'last AR no matter what' as the goal -- holding it past the point of diminishing returns only "
    "exposes the region to an opponent Event flipping it back before you cash in.",
    "  - If one region has been scored recently, it's less likely to reapear, focus on regions that will score in the near future.",
    "  - Your own cards and NEUTRAL cards never fire an opponent Event when you play "
    "them for Ops. Space Racing one 'so the opponent doesn't get the event' is a "
    "misread -- only the OPPONENT's own cards carry that risk.",
    "  - One Space Race attempt per turn (two only from the box the rules name). The "
    "board report states how many you have left: check it BEFORE choosing a card to "
    "discard there, because the card is committed before the mode is.",
    "  - A big NEUTRAL Ops card (Nuclear Test Ban, Red Scare/Purge, ABM Treaty) is worth "
    "more as Ops or a coup than as a headline or a Space Race discard.",
    "  - Answer the opponent, not just your own plan. Every opponent placement listed "
    "under OPPONENT ACTIVITY is a claim you either answer now or concede.",
    "  - Meet the Military Operations requirement every turn. It equals DEFCON",
    "  - Before using a scoring card, a good strategy is breaking control on some key countries controlled by the rival.",

    "fired -- until then it's a fully safe 4-Ops card, as good as any other for "
    "an early coup. Prefer spending a safe card like NATO on an early coup and "

    "  - Turn 1: Jordan or Lebanon to shield Israel, Egypt toward Libya before Nasser, Malaysia toward Thailand, Greece for access.",
    "  - Counter-coup Iran only if their coup was weak. Prefer holding the turn's last coup over the second-to-last.",
    "  - Stay out of South Korea until Korean War is spent or you hold Japan. Triggering Korean War yourself early is usually right.",
    "  - Trigger USSR starred Events while they're cheap: Korean War, Nasser, Warsaw Pact, Comecon, Blockade.",
