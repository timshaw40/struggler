"""Provider-agnostic contract for talking to an LLM.

`LLMClient` mirrors how `struggler.engine.player.Player` is a structural
`Protocol` rather than a base class: any object with a matching `complete`
method is a valid client, no inheritance required. `LLMPlayer` (see
`player.py`) only ever depends on this module -- never on a specific
vendor SDK -- so adding a new provider means writing a new adapter module
(see `anthropic_client.py`), not touching the bot's decision logic.
