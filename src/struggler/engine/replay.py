"""Deterministic replay: the primary testing strategy (docs/TESTING.md).

A replay log is {seed, actions, checkpoints} plus a start descriptor:

- Full games set ``"new_game": true`` (optionally ``"include_optional"``);
  the whole game — headline picks, card plays, and dice — lives in
  ``actions``, since chance is a logged CHANCE decision (mandate #3).
  Adding ``"events": true`` turns on the card-event layer (see events.py).
- Board-only sandbox logs instead carry a ``setup`` object naming one of the
  begin_* Ops-only entry points, a scaffold for the pre-card milestone.

Because chance is replayed from the same seeded RNG, either kind of log is
byte-for-byte reproducible with no separate RNG trace to keep in sync.

Golden fixtures under tests/replays/ are hand/script-built and read-only,
and pin a ``checkpoints`` list of full ``engine.serialize()`` snapshots so
``run_with_checkpoints`` can assert byte-for-byte equality against a fixed
expectation. ``GameLogWriter`` is the write direction for a *live* game
instead: it lets ``runner.play_game`` record an actually-played game to
disk, in the same ``new_game``/``actions`` shape (each entry enriched via
``encode_event`` with who acted and what changed) but without
``checkpoints`` — a played game isn't being checked against a pinned
snapshot, and ``seed + actions`` alone already reproduces it exactly, so
the file stays readable instead of embedding raw internal state. It's
still fully replayable via ``run_replay``.

``replay_history`` (backed by ``HistoryBuilder``, also used live by
``runner.play_game``) is the resume direction: it rebuilds both the
``Engine`` and the Player-facing ``history`` sequence from a log, so a game
interrupted mid-way (or a log hand-trimmed to undo a bad decision before
resuming) can hand a fresh ``Player`` -- including a resumed ``LLMPlayer``,
see ``bots/llm/conversation_log.py``'s resumption contract -- a `history`
consistent with what it would have seen live.
