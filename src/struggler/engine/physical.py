"""OperatorConsolePlayer: the console interface for physical-mode games.

In physical mode (see `Engine.new_game(physical_mode=..., physical_side=...)`
and docs/BOTS.md) one seat is a real human playing
the physical board game. The operator — the person at the table running
this tool — is the single source of truth for everything the engine can't
know on its own: both hands' card-by-card dealing, every dice roll (both
sides'), and the physical side's own moves, typed in after they happen on
the real board. `runner.play_game` routes all of that to one
`OperatorConsolePlayer` instance, registered under both `players[physical_side]`
and `players[Side.CHANCE]`. The bot/AI side's own strategic decisions are
untouched — they still go to its own ordinary `Player`.

Reuses `HumanPlayer`'s prompt/format helpers (`human.py`) rather than
duplicating them; only the "too many options for a numbered list" case
(mandate #2's documented physical-mode exception) needs its own free-text
matching.
