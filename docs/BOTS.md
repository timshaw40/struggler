# Bot framework

The engine's job is to be a fair arbiter, not to know who's playing. Every
seat — human or bot — plugs in through the same interface, so human-vs-human,
human-vs-bot, and bot-vs-bot are one code path, and adding a new bot never
touches the engine.

## The `Player` interface

`struggler.engine.player.Player` is a structural `Protocol`, not a base
class: any object with a matching `choose_action` method is a `Player`, no
inheritance required — consistent with the rest of the project's
API-surface philosophy: the contract is a shape, not a class hierarchy.

```python
class Player(Protocol):
    def choose_action(self, observation: Observation, history: Sequence[Event]) -> Action:
        """Pick one action from `observation.pending_decision.options`."""
```

- A player only ever sees `observe(side)` (mandate #4) and returns one
  `Action` drawn verbatim from `pending_decision.options` (mandate #2) —
  the same constraints a human at the console has.
- `history` is every resolved `(Decision, Action)` pair so far, oldest
  first (opponent moves and CHANCE rolls included), as a
  `engine.player.Event` list — one shared, ever-growing list, not a
  per-player delta since that seat was last consulted. The one ordering
  exception is the headline: both `HEADLINE_PLAY` events are buffered by
  `engine.replay.HistoryBuilder` (used internally by `runner.play_game`)
  and appended together once the second pick is locked in, so the second
  picker's `history` can't leak the first pick. Bots are free to ignore it;
  it exists so a player *can* condition on what just happened without
  re-deriving it from `Observation` alone.
- One optional second method, `bind_engine(engine)`: if a `Player` defines
  it, `runner.play_game` calls it once before the game starts, handing the
  live `Engine` to bots that need more than an `Observation` — today that
  is `MCTSPlayer`, whose search clones the game via
  `serialize()`/`deserialize()`. The `Protocol` still requires only
  `choose_action`; every other bot is untouched.
- `Side.CHANCE` decisions (coup/realignment/space-race rolls, ...) never
  reach a `Player` at all in an ordinary game — `struggler.runner.play_game`
  resolves them directly from the pre-drawn single option `Decision.options`
  already carries (mandate #3: the roll already happened via the engine's
  seeded RNG; there is nothing left to decide). The one exception is
  physical mode (below), where a `Side.CHANCE` entry in `players` is the
  operator console.
- `struggler.runner.play_game(engine, {Side.US: ..., Side.USSR: ...})` runs
  a game to completion, building the shared `Event` history and dispatching
  each non-CHANCE decision to the registered `Player` for that decision's
  `actor`.

## Building players

There is no registry: `src/main.py`'s `build_player(kind, *, seed=0)` is a
plain `if`/`elif` over kind names (`"human"`, `"first"`, `"random"`,
`"greedy"`, `"mcts"`, `"llm"`), each branch constructing the corresponding `Player`
directly (`HumanPlayer`, `FirstLegalPlayer`/`RandomPlayer` from
`bots/naive.py`, `GreedyPlayer` from `bots/greedy.py`, `MCTSPlayer` from
`bots/mcts.py`, `LLMPlayer` from
`bots/llm/player.py` — the `"llm"` branch also picks a provider client via
`STRUGGLER_LLM_PROVIDER`/`STRUGGLER_LLM_MODEL`, and passes through
`plan_turns` from `--no-turn-plan`). Adding a new bot means
implementing `Player` and adding one branch to `build_player` — no
self-registration, no import-order dependency, no indirection between a
name and the class it builds.

## Physical mode

`Engine.new_game(..., physical_mode=True, physical_side=Side.US | Side.USSR)`
lets one seat be a real human playing the physical board game, with the
engine as referee/state-tracker — the setup for testing a bot/AI against a
physical opponent. `physical_mode` is a construction-time `Engine` flag, not
a `build_player` kind, because it changes engine behavior (dealing, dice),
not just which `Player` answers decisions; `src/main.py`'s `--physical
{us,ussr}` flag builds the engine this way (the bot side is still built
normally from `--us`/`--ussr`).

Two things the engine cannot know on its own once one seat is physical:

- **The physical side's hand is genuinely unknown to the engine itself**
  (not merely hidden from the opponent via `observe()`, mandate #4's usual
  guarantee) — there's no seeded RNG that can predict what a real shuffle
  dealt. `Engine.hidden_pool` (a plain `list[str]`, mandate #5) tracks real
  card ids not yet matched to a known location; the physical hand's own
  entries are the `HIDDEN_CARD` (`"?"`) sentinel until a card is revealed
  (played, discarded, or otherwise disclosed by an event), at which point
  `Engine.declare_physical_card`/`_reveal_in_hand`/`_hand_remove_known`
  move it out of the pool for good.
- **Every dice roll — both sides' — is entered manually**, since there is
  one physical board and real dice are used for every roll on it,
  regardless of which side nominally triggered it. Each `*_ROLL` call site
  uses `Engine._d6_actions`, which — under `physical_mode` — pushes all six
  possible outcomes as `Decision.options` (still `actor=Side.CHANCE`)
  instead of one pre-drawn value (mandate #3: chance is still fully exposed
  as a decision, just resolved by a human instead of the seeded RNG).

Because there is a **single shared physical deck**, the non-physical side's
hand can't be auto-dealt by the seeded shuffle either: the operator declares
it card by card too (`DecisionKind.DEAL_CARD`, `actor=Side.CHANCE`, since
dealing isn't a strategic choice). The physical side's own hand is topped
up silently (nothing new is *learned* by the engine, still just a count).

All of this — both hands' dealing, every dice roll, and the physical side's
own moves — is answered by one `struggler.engine.physical.OperatorConsolePlayer`
instance, registered in `players` under **both** `physical_side` and
`Side.CHANCE`; `runner.play_game` routes to it accordingly. The bot side's
own `Player` is completely untouched — it still only ever computes its own
strategic decisions from `Observation`/`history`, unaware anything is
different about this game.

The one bot decision that *does* need out-of-band handling is its Headline
pick: `HEADLINE_PLAY` events are picked secretly and only revealed once
both sides have chosen (see "the headline" exception above), so a bot's
pick would otherwise only surface in `OperatorConsolePlayer`'s "since you
were last asked" recap the *next* time the operator is prompted for
anything — often too late for the physical reveal step the operator needs
to perform right now. `src/main.py`'s `--physical` and `--resume-game-log`
branches wrap the bot side's `Player` in
`struggler.engine.physical.BotHeadlineAnnouncer`, which prints the bot's
Headline pick to the console the moment it's chosen so the operator can
place the matching physical card at reveal time. Every other bot decision
still surfaces in time via the ordinary recap.

That announcement only arrives before the operator's own pick if the bot
is actually asked first: non-physical games always ask USSR then US, but
`Engine._headline_pick_order` overrides that in physical mode so the bot
side goes first regardless of which side it is, and the physical side
second. The physical side commits to a real card at the table independently
of when the app asks, so going second costs it no information — and it's
what makes the announcement useful instead of arriving after the fact.

Space Race box 4 (6.4.4) flips that physical-mode default when the *bot*
holds the ability: the operator is asked (and must genuinely place their
real card on the board) first, and the bot picks second, informed by it
(`_push_headline` surfaces the operator's pick as `opponent_headline` in
the bot's decision context) — the "costs it no information" rationale above
no longer applies once the bot's own pick is supposed to depend on the
operator's. Box 4 held by the physical side instead needs no special case:
the unconditional bot-first default already reveals the bot's card to the
operator before their own pick, which is exactly what the ability grants
them.

Every hand-touching event is wired for a physical hidden hand. Three need
the *deciding* side to inspect a hand it cannot see. Missile Envy's
`choose_side` is overridden to `Side.CHANCE`, sourcing candidates from
`_physical_hand_candidates` and routing the choice the same way `DEAL_CARD`
does — the operator, not a bot that cannot see the target hand, answers
directly. Aldrich Ames Remix and The Cambridge Five instead reveal first
and decide second, since their printed effect is "reveal the hand, *then*
choose": Aldrich Ames has the operator declare every still-hidden slot's
real card one at a time (`_push_aldrich_ames_reveal`, options sourced from
`hidden_pool` the same way `DEAL_CARD` is) until the whole hand is known,
then routes the actual choice to the real USSR `Player` — the LLM bot
included — exactly as in a non-physical game, rather than the US operator
picking on the bot's behalf. The Cambridge Five asks one per-scoring-card
yes/no `EVENT_CHOICE` query at a time instead (`_push_cambridge_five_query`).
All three respect one invariant that `_physical_hand_candidates` and
`push_random_discard`'s physical branch enforce elsewhere too: **candidates
must respect the hand's true, always-public size**, so both reveal loops
stop the moment the last open `HIDDEN_CARD` slot is filled — asking further
would have nowhere left to reveal an answer into.

Two placement details matter for a physical hand. Missile Envy's picked
card stays visible in the giver's hand (`_reveal_in_hand`, not an immediate
removal) until `missile_envy_use` resolves it one or two decisions later —
mirroring the non-physical path, and, like Grain Sales' revealed-but-
undecided card, avoiding a window where the card is tracked nowhere at all.
And `missile_envy_use`'s `_file_card` call passes
`already_removed_from_hand=True`, since the taken card was never genuinely
in the *taker's* hand (the same pattern as Star Wars'
`play_card_from_discard`); without it, `_file_card` would misread an
ordinary card transfer as one of the taker's own cards leaving and strip an
unrelated placeholder.

Cards where the deciding side owns the hand being asked about (Blockade,
Latin American Debt Crisis, Ask Not…, Nixon Plays the China Card,
Quagmire/Bear Trap discard, Held Card discard) and the random-reveal cards
(Grain Sales to Soviets, Five Year Plan, Terrorism) are wired too.

What physical mode cannot enforce or model is listed in
[LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md).

## Game-level logging

Separate from any LLM player's own reasoning log
(`bots/llm/conversation_log.py`, that player's private conversation
state), `runner.play_game(engine, players, log_path=...)` can record the
game itself as it's played, via `engine.replay.GameLogWriter`. It writes
a lean `{seed, new_game, include_optional, events, actions, winner}`
replay log — the same `new_game`/`actions` shape the "Deterministic
replay logs" testing strategy reads (`run_replay`), but without a
`checkpoints` section: that's golden-fixture furniture for pinning a
byte-for-byte `engine.serialize()` snapshot, which a live game isn't
being checked against, and `seed + actions` alone is already sufficient
to reproduce it exactly. Each `actions` entry is `encode_event`'s output,
not a bare `{kind, payload}` — actor, and (when it targets a country)
that country's resulting influence/control plus DEFCON/VP/turn/round,
the same fields `engine.human._format_event` shows a human player between
prompts — so the file reads as a play-by-play, not raw internal state.
`replay.py` is now both the reader (golden fixtures under
`tests/replays/`, via `run_replay`/`run_with_checkpoints`) and the writer
(live games, via `GameLogWriter`) of one format, not two modules
maintaining it separately. The file is atomically rewritten after every
step (same tempfile+`os.replace`, warn-not-raise pattern as
`conversation_log.save`), so a crash mid-game still leaves a replayable,
if truncated, log. `src/main.py` enables this by default
(`./logs/{timestamp}_game.json`; `--game-log-path` to override,
`--no-game-log` to disable), independent of whether either seat is an
LLM. This resolves the open question the LLM-tier roadmap note below used
to defer ("do the model's reasoning turns count as 'moves' in a replay
log, or stay external to it"): they stay external — the game log is the
engine-level action record, the LLM conversation log is a separate,
player-private artifact, and the two are never merged.

**Resuming a live game** (`--resume-game-log <path>`, `src/main.py`) is the
other direction: `engine.replay.replay_history(log)` replays a game log's
`actions` (same mechanism as `run_replay`) and, alongside it, rebuilds the
`Player`-facing `history` via `HistoryBuilder`, so a fresh `Player`
consulted from that point on sees the same `history` it would have live —
in particular satisfying a resumed `LLMPlayer`'s contract that `history` be
at least as long as its restored `last_seen` (`bots/llm/conversation_log.py`).
Hand-trimming a log's `actions` before resuming (e.g. to undo a bad play)
is the intended way to correct a game already in progress; an `LLMPlayer`
resumed with `--resume` alongside it should have its own conversation log
trimmed in step (drop the trailing message/journal entries for the undone
decisions, and roll `last_seen` back to match), or its memory and the
actual game state will disagree. `play_game`'s `initial_actions` parameter
lets the on-disk log continue accumulating at the same path instead of
restarting.

## Roadmap

Five tiers, in the order they're worth building — each one a strictly
bigger investment than the last, and each fully usable on its own once
built:

1. **Trivial baselines** (done): `FirstLegalPlayer` (deterministic, always
   the first legal option) and `RandomPlayer` (uniform over legal options,
   using its own seeded RNG — never the engine's, so a bot's choices never
   perturb or depend on the engine's own dice sequence, keeping replay logs
   reproducible regardless of which bots produced them). These exist mainly
   as a floor to measure every later bot against.
2. **Greedy / rule-based** (current — `bots/greedy.py`): observe the
   state, score every legal action of the *current* decision with
   hand-crafted heuristics, take the top score. No lookahead, no search, no
   opponent modeling — see "Greedy bot design" below.
3. **LLM reasoning layer** (built — `bots/llm/`): a prompt carrying the
   `Observation`, the `Event` history (or a summarized form of it), and the
   model's own prior reasoning for this game lets the model pick an
   action each decision. The natural-language reasoning trace is itself
   useful output (an explainable "why"), unlike Greedy or RL. It needed
   nothing new from the engine, since `Player` already receives everything
   an LLM prompt would need and returns everything
   `step()` needs to advance — the tier is prompt engineering
   (`prompt.py`, `rules_primer.py`) plus response parsing into a legal
   `Action` (`schema.py`), over a provider-agnostic `LLMClient` with
   Anthropic, OpenAI, and OpenAI-compatible adapters (local servers like LM Studio or Ollama via `STRUGGLER_LLM_BASE_URL`). The one new plumbing question this tier
   raised — do the model's reasoning turns count as "moves" in a replay
   log, or stay external to it — is answered in "Game-level logging"
   above: they stay external. What the model is actually shown, and the
   turn-level plan it plays to, are in "LLM bot: the board reading and the
   turn plan" below. This tier needed exactly one thing from the engine:
   `Observation.space_race_attempts` (see below).
4. **Search: MCTS** (built — `bots/mcts.py`): Monte Carlo Tree Search over
   the current decision, with `GreedyPlayer` as the rollout / opponent
   policy. No training data, no GPU, no LLM calls. This is the first bot
   that looks ahead; it should sit in "stronger than greedy" territory, not
   expert-claim territory. See "MCTS bot" below.
5. **Self-play reinforcement learning** (future, most promising long-term,
   most expensive to build): train a model by having it play itself
   repeatedly via `play_game`, using `Engine.winner` as the terminal reward.
   The most future-relevant reason `GreedyPlayer` is built as weighted
   features over `board_value()` rather than an if/elif cascade: a linear
   (or larger) model over the same feature set, with *learned* instead of
   hand-set weights, is a structurally compatible next step — swap
   `GreedyWeights` for trained parameters, or replace `board_value()` with
   a learned value function outright, without redesigning how a `Player`
   plugs into the engine. `Engine.serialize()`/`deserialize()` (mandate #5)
   are what make self-play cheap: cloning state for search/training doesn't
   need a bespoke copy path. MCTS is the stepping-stone: the same clone
   path, with a learned value function instead of greedy rollouts.

## MCTS bot

`MCTSPlayer` (`bots/mcts.py`) implements the same `Player` protocol as the
other bots. `runner.play_game` calls `bind_engine` once so search can
`serialize()`/`deserialize()` clones; it never `step()`s the live engine.

Each `choose_action` runs root UCT over `pending_decision.options`: untried
actions first, then UCB1. Every simulation determinizes hidden cards, plays
the chosen root action on a clone, then rolls out with `GreedyPlayer` for
**both** seats (including the DEFCON self-kill penalty) until the game ends
or `rollout_depth` steps. Terminal reward is 1 / 0.5 / 0 (win / draw /
loss); a depth-cap uses `tanh(board_value / 20)` mapped to `[0, 1]`. Chance
decisions use the clone's pre-drawn `options[0]`, same as `play_game`.
The live engine's RNG is never touched; search uses `random.Random(seed)`
and reseeds each clone from that.

### Imperfect-information approximation

`observe()` does not include the opponent's hand or the draw pile. Each
sim fills those slots (and a still-secret opponent headline) from the
unknown pool: cards that have entered by the current turn, minus this
side's hand, discard, removed pile, and in-flight cards already named by
frozen fields (own headline, resolving headlines, Our Man in Tehran's
queue). Search reads **lengths** of hidden fields, not their card ids.

This is a standard determinize-then-search approximation, not a solver of
imperfect-information games. Physical mode is refused outright (`bind_engine`
raises): a physical hand's real card ids sit in `hidden_pool`, which the bot
does not redact, so searching there would peek — use greedy as the physical
opponent instead.

### Knobs

| Knob | Default | Constructor | Env (via `build_player`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| simulations per decision | 16 | `sims=` | `STRUGGLER_MCTS_SIMS` |
| greedy rollout cap | 16 | `rollout_depth=` | `STRUGGLER_MCTS_ROLLOUT_DEPTH` |
| UCB1 exploration constant | 1.4 | `uct_c=` | `STRUGGLER_MCTS_UCT_C` |

Raise `sims` for stronger (slower) play. Eval uses a lower default (`--sims 8`)
so a batch of games finishes in minutes, not hours.

### How to run

```sh
python src/main.py --us human --ussr mcts --seed 1
python src/main.py --us greedy --ussr mcts --seed 1
STRUGGLER_MCTS_SIMS=32 python src/main.py --ussr mcts

python scripts/eval_mcts_vs_greedy.py --games 10 --seed 1 --sims 8
python scripts/eval_mcts_vs_greedy.py --games 10 --no-events
```

`eval_mcts_vs_greedy.py` plays MCTS vs greedy in both seats, then prints
wins/losses/draws, win rate, and wall time.

## LLM bot: the board reading and the turn plan

Two decisions shape this bot far more than the model behind it: **what it
is shown**, and **when it decides anything larger than one action**. Both
were rebuilt after reviewing a lost game whose every response was legal
and whose every response was made in isolation.

### The prompt is a board reading, not a state dump

`prompt.py` used to hand the model `Observation` as JSON: 85 countries as
two integers each, and nothing else. Everything that actually decides a
game — who Controls what, which Battlegrounds are contested, what a region
would score if its card were played now, how many points a country still
needs — is a *derivation* off that table, and re-deriving all of it on
every decision is not something to spend model attention on. So
`board_report.py` computes them once, from the same public data the player
is already entitled to (a `Board` loaded from the `Observation`, the same
trick `GreedyPlayer._sync_board` uses, plus the full public `history` for
anything -- currently just "when was this region last scored" -- that
needs to look back further than one call's worth of events), and renders:

- **Military Operations** as the VP it will cost, not a track position.
- **Space Race** attempts left this turn, and what the next box needs.
- **Regional scoring status**: each region's net VP *signed for the acting
  side* (`Board.score_region`), each side's tier, whether that region's
  Scoring card is in hand, already played, or still live, the most recent
  turn it was scored (`board_report.region_last_scored`, derived from
  `history`, or "never"), and what each side is still missing for its next
  Presence/Domination/Control tier there (`board_report.tier_progress` --
  a direct restatement of `Board.region_tier`'s own formula, e.g. "1 more
  Battleground (Iraq, Israel) and 1 more non-Battleground (Lebanon,
  Jordan)"; not a heuristic guess).
- **Battleground priorities**: what to RETAKE (Battlegrounds you have
  Influence in but don't Control), what is AT RISK (Controlled by a thin
  margin), and what is UNCLAIMED and reachable — each with the Ops cost,
  doubling rule included.
- **Coup targets**: every country currently Coup-able — opponent Influence
  present, DEFCON allows the region (`RULES["coup_min_defcon"]`) — flagged
  Battleground or not (the same proxy legality `GreedyPlayer` uses, not a
  replica of NATO/The Reformer/the US-Japan pact; `legal_actions()` still
  has final say on a specific pick). If DEFCON is already at 2 and *every*
  available target is a Battleground, the report says so explicitly:
  Couping any of them drops DEFCON to 1, an instant loss, and the model
  should not be left to re-derive that from the DEFCON-drop rule itself.
- **Opponent activity** since the bot last acted, restated per country as
  a claim to answer.
- **The whole map**, one dense line per country: Battleground flag,
  stability, both influences, controller, `need:+n` / `brk:+n`, and
  reachability. Every country, including 0-0 ones — an empty reachable
  Battleground is exactly the cheapest VP on the board, and filtering
  those out once made them invisible for a whole game.

Nothing in that module is a heuristic or a recommendation: every number is
a rules-defined fact a human reads straight off the board. The judgement
lives in the strategic guidance in `prompt.py` and in the card playbook.

The hand gets its own dossier, built per decision rather than left to the
full card catalog in the system prompt: this turn's *effective* Ops
(Containment/Brezhnev/Red Scare applied), whose Event it is — with the
rule that only the **opponent's** cards fire an Event on an Ops play —
whether it is starred, and **whether a Space Race play is even available
for it right now**. That last one closes a real trap: the card is
committed one decision before its mode is, so "can I Space Race this?"
has to be answerable while picking the card.

`Observation.space_race_attempts` exists for that line. It is public board
state (an attempt is an announced, visible discard) that the engine
tracked and simply never surfaced; without it a player cannot tell whether
a Space Race play is legal until after committing the card.

### `card_playbook.json`: judgement, kept out of `data/`

`struggler/data/` holds the game's facts — what a card *does*. How to
*play* a card well is an opinion, one bot's, and a different (or re-tuned)
bot would legitimately disagree, so the playbook lives next to the player
that consumes it, the same separation `GreedyWeights` already draws.
Entries are keyed by card id with optional `any` / `US` / `USSR` advice,
rendered only for cards actually in hand, and only for that seat.
Coverage is incomplete by design and grows card by card — the same
pattern `_SCORERS` uses for decision kinds. A card with no entry
contributes no advice line, never a placeholder. `tests/test_llm_card_playbook.py`
pins the key set against `cards.json` so the file cannot drift into naming
a card that doesn't exist.

### The turn plan

`justification` on a decision plan is explainability, explicitly not
memory. That left nothing standing between decisions: a Scoring card could
sit in hand for six action rounds while each decision was optimized on its
own and the region it obliged the bot to score was never invested in.

So the first real decision of each game turn triggers one extra call
against a second output spec (`TURN_PLAN_SCHEMA`), which takes no action
at all. It produces intent: an assessment, one objective, a `region_focus`
naming which region(s) this turn's Ops should concentrate on (in priority
order — any region whose Scoring card is in hand comes first since it must
be played this turn regardless; with none in hand, `prompt.py`'s planning
request tells the model to prefer the region(s) with the oldest "last
scored" turn in the board report's regional scoring status, "never"
outranking every turn number), a use for every card in hand, when each
Scoring card gets played and what must change in that region first, the
Ops that will meet the Military Operations requirement, the Battlegrounds
to hold or retake, and contingencies for opponent plays that would break
the plan. `render_turn_plan` then re-injects it into every user turn for
the rest of that turn, and each decision is asked to say how it serves the
plan — or why the board changed.

The planning request also states the turn's round budget explicitly —
`action_rounds(observation.turn)` (6 early-war, 7 mid/late) minus the
current `action_round`, i.e. how many action rounds are actually left to
spend a card in — so the model can't schedule more cards than it has
rounds for. Each `card_plan` entry carries an `order`: `-1` for a card
meant to be held, `0` for this turn's headline, `1, 2, 3...` for the
sequence cards are meant to be played in across the remaining action
rounds. `render_turn_plan` sorts by it (headline, then action rounds in
order, held cards last) so the standing plan reads as a play sequence, not
just a per-card use.

- Planning failure is never fatal: `_planned_turn` is stamped either way,
  so a turn whose planning call failed plays without a plan instead of
  retrying at every decision.
- It costs one call per turn. `LLMPlayer(plan_turns=False)` (CLI:
  `--no-turn-plan`) turns it off, which is also how to measure what the
  plan is worth.
- The current plan is persisted (`ConversationSnapshot.turn_plan`/
  `planned_turn`, snapshot version 2 — version 1 files still load, planless),
  so a resumed player picks the turn up with the intent it was playing to
  rather than mid-turn with none. Every plan the game has produced so far is
  separately kept in full in `ConversationSnapshot.turn_plan_history`
  (snapshot version 3 — version 1/2 files still load, with an empty
  history), oldest first, purely as a record for reading back later; nothing
  re-injects from it, that's still `turn_plan` above.

Both output specs share one retry/fallback path
(`LLMPlayer._attempt_with_retry`) and one journal, with `JournalEntry.kind`
(`"decision"` / `"turn_plan"`) separating intent from execution.

## Greedy bot design: the decision space, and how it's scored

The hard part of a Twilight Struggle bot is not "evaluate a board" — it's
that a turn is never one decision. `pending_decision.kind` (see
`DecisionKind`) ranges over ~20 shapes: place one Influence point, pick a
Coup or Realignment target, choose Influence vs. Coup vs. Realignment for
this Ops spend, choose which card to headline or play this round, choose
Ops vs. Event vs. Space Race for a played card, and (with the event layer
on) another ~13 event-specific shapes (WAR_TARGET, EVENT_CHOICE,
EVENT_INFLUENCE, EVENT_OPS_ORDER, QUAGMIRE_DISCARD, HELD_CARD_DISCARD,
EVENT_RESUME, ...). Mandate #2 (atomic actions) is exactly what makes this
tractable for a greedy bot: every one of those decisions offers **tens** of
options, never thousands, so "score every legal option, take the best" is
cheap even without any pruning.

`GreedyPlayer` (`bots/greedy.py`) handles this with one scorer function
per `DecisionKind`, dispatched from a `_SCORERS` table, all funneling
through a single static evaluator:

```python
def board_value(weights: GreedyWeights, board: Board, side: Side) -> float:
    """Regional Presence/Domination/Control tiers, plus a flat bonus per
    country Controlled (extra for Battlegrounds). Higher is better for `side`."""
```

- **Influence placement**: score = the `board_value` swing from adding
  that one point (a real, cheap simulation on a scratch `Board` — not a
  multi-turn lookahead, just "what does this single atomic action change
  right now").
- **Coup / Realignment targets**: the outcome is a die roll, so the score
  is the *expectation* (average roll = 3.5) of the same `board_value`
  swing, not a real simulated outcome — realignment's dice cancel neatly in
  expectation (`own_bonus - opp_bonus`), since both sides roll.
- **Ops type** (Influence vs. Coup vs. Realignment): reuses the same
  per-target scorers over a proxy target list built from public board data
  (`Board.is_reachable`, `Board.influence_cost`, the
  `RULES["coup_min_defcon"]` table) — not a duplicate of the engine's exact
  legality (NATO-style locks aren't replicated here), since a wrong guess
  here only costs a slightly
  worse **choice**, never an illegal `Action` (the engine's real
  `legal_actions()` is always what's actually offered downstream).
- **DEFCON safety** (priority #1): a Coup
  attempt against a Battleground country drops DEFCON by 1 for the *acting*
  side (Nuclear Subs excepted; non-Battleground targets never touch DEFCON);
  if DEFCON is already 2, a Battleground Coup is the acting side's own loss.
  This is
  checked at the OPS_TYPE decision (refusing "coup" outright, so the
  suicidal choice is never made in the first place) and again defensively
  at COUP_TARGET (in case OPS_TYPE's cheaper proxy legality missed a lock
  the real engine enforces) — `defcon_self_kill_penalty` in `GreedyWeights`
  is orders of magnitude above every other weight specifically so this
  never gets outweighed by board value.
- **Which card, and how to spend it** (headline pick, action-round card
  pick, Ops vs. Event vs. Space Race mode): a card not worth its Ops value
  right now is worth more sent to the Space Race track instead (its
  expected VP, computed from `SPACE_RACE_BOXES`' roll odds, against the
  Ops-point value forfeited) — the concrete form of "send bad cards to the
  Space Race." A scoring card's headline/play value is its `score_region()`
  net VP, signed favorably or unfavorably for the acting side.

Only the core board decision kinds get real heuristics; every
event-specific kind falls back to the first legal option. That scope, and
why it is deliberate, is in [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md) — extend
`_SCORERS` as each kind earns a heuristic worth writing.

`tests/test_greedy.py` covers the DEFCON safety rule, the fallback
behavior, and a win-rate sanity check (`GreedyPlayer` vs. `RandomPlayer`
over many seeds, both seat assignments) — a regression net for "the
heuristics still actually help," not a claim of strategic strength.


## Autonomous improvement tooling

Three loops for improving a bot without a human in the driver's seat. All are
pure-stdlib (no numpy/torch) and use `multiprocessing("spawn")`.

- **`arena.py`** — the evaluation backbone. `PlayerSpec` names a
  reconstructible bot (greedy with a weights dict, mcts, random, first);
  `run_matchup`/`round_robin` play each seed twice with the seats swapped so
  side asymmetry cancels; `head_to_head`, `score`, `matchup_table`, and a
  simple `elo` read the results. `scripts/run_arena.py` is the CLI.
  **Evaluate against a ladder, and gate on head-to-head, never on win rate
  vs one fixed opponent** — that saturates and misleads once a bot passes it.
- **`scripts/tune_greedy.py`** — CEM over `GreedyWeights`. Sampling is a
  Gaussian in log-weight space (all tunable weights are positive); fitness is
  the mean score across a fixed ladder (random, first, incumbent) on
  side-swapped seeds. `defcon_self_kill_penalty` is a guardrail and is never
  tuned. The best candidate is re-scored on a *held-out* seed bank against the
  incumbent and only saved if it wins. This deliberately avoids the earlier
  champion-vs-challenger self-play tuner's failure mode (a single opponent).
- **`bots/value.py` + `scripts/train_value.py`** — a learned, antisymmetric
  board value (`value(US) + value(USSR) = 1`) over ~19 public-state features,
  fit by closed-form ridge regression on self-play outcomes. Pass it to
  `MCTSPlayer(value=...)`; it replaces the greedy rollout's terminal estimate,
  so `rollout_depth` can drop to 0 — measured ~70x faster per decision at the
  same sim count in one position.

Runtime knobs (env, read by `build_player`): `STRUGGLER_GREEDY_WEIGHTS` (a
weights JSON) and `STRUGGLER_MCTS_VALUE` (a value JSON) let the live game use
a tuned artifact without code changes. Artifacts live under `data/`
(gitignored).

The intended sequence: build the arena first, tune the linear greedy with CEM,
learn the value and cheapen MCTS, then move to PPO self-play with league
anchors and H2H Elo gates (tier 5). Behavior cloning from the small expert
corpus is only an opening prior — it plateaus near the teacher.
